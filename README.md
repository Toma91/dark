Fun learning (?) lexing & parsing with Swift (and of Swift).

I never did or studied stuff about compilers or related arguments, but I read the Kaleidoscope tutorial on the LLVM website and thought "Eh, that seems easy!".
So I thought that I could try to write the Swift Lexer & Parser in Swift itself... how fool I am!

Essentially this repo is just me testing stuff and make mistake upon mistake :)
